# yt-snip-chrome

I made this to help make YouTube video snips with [gvlasov/yt-snip](https://github.com/gvlasov/yt-snip)

## Installation

1. Open chrome://extensions in Chrome/Chromium
2. Click "Load unpacked"
3. In file dialog, select `src` directory
4. Reload Youtube page

## Usage

1. To mark the beginning and the end of the part of the video you want to snip, press Ctrl+Shift+E
2. On the second press it will put the `yt-snip` command in copy buffer, and also print it in an alert
